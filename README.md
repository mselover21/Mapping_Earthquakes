# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to familirize myself with the use of API's and Javascript to read GeoJSON data. With earthquake data I created three different maps layers using Mapbox styling and added filters to tell a story. I added the tectonic plate lines to the map as a filter to better see where the majority of earthquakes take place. Additionally I added a filter for just the largest earthquakes to display only the highest magnitude earthquakes. Overall the data is useful for most people who are not familiar with earthquakes by visually showing that most earthquakes take place on fault lines between tectonic plates.
